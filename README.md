A comprehensive list of papers about "**Cognitively Inspired NLP: a Survey and a Vision**"
## Abstract

With the rapid advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, the interpretability and human-like characteristics of current language models have become a primary concern for NLP scientists. To address these challenges, interdisciplinary methods from Cognitive Science have been incorporated into NLP research. Concurrently, cognitive scientists have also leveraged NLP technology to enhance their studies on human cognition. Cognitive Science is a diverse discipline where existing studies often concentrate on cognitive theories within their respective domains. These theories are typically grounded in certain assumptions, complicating comparisons between different approaches. Therefore, this review is intended to provide an overall landscape of more than 200 papers on the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Cognitive Science, and establish a unified formulation encompassing recent developments in cognitively inspired NLP work, offering insights into the symbiotic relationship between NLP and Cognitive Science. Additionally, we synthesize several research directions in NLP under the context of Cognitive Science and present a forward-looking perspective on future research directions, with the intention of inspiring and guiding further advancements in NLP research.

## Cognitive Science

Cognitive Science endeavors to demystify the processes and laws underpinning the relationship between the mind and neural activities. It aims to illuminate phenomena such as learning, memory, thought, and understanding, with an overarching goal of comprehending the intricate operations of the human mind. Its complexity and depth have often led Cognitive Science to be characterized as 'God's last secret'. Concretely, Cognitive Science encompasses six primary research domains.
